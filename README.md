# INTRODUCTION
In fact, data cleaning in Microsoft Excel offers a variety of methods. In my previous attempts, I highlighted the utilization of Excel functions to cleanse this identical dataset. 

However, today, I harnessed one of Excel's potent features to extract and transform the dataset, preparing it for subsequent analysis.

The messy dataset contains customer details that are jumbled together in a single cell within the spreadsheet. The information includes customer names, addresses, ages, and genders.

The primary goal of this data cleaning exercise is to extract and organize the customer details into separate columns, ensuring that each piece of information, such as customer names, addresses, ages, and genders, occupies its designated column for a well-structured dataset.
